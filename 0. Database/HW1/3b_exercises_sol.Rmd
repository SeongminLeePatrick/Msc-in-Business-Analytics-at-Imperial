We will work with [Composition of Foods Raw, Processed, Prepared USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/composition-of-foods-raw-processed-prepared-usda-national-nutrient-database-for-standard-r). See [here](https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/nutrients/index) for an interactive search.

Before you start:

* download `data/usda_utf8.sql` from the Materials
* in pgAdmin, create a new database, `nutrients`
* select it and open PSQL console (in Plugins or main menu, in pgAdmin 3)
* write `\i your_path/to/usda_utf8.sql` to import it and press Enter
* write `\q` and press Enter to quit the console

Now connect to this database:

```{r}
library(RPostgreSQL)
password <- .rs.askForPassword("Your database password.")
drv <- dbDriver("PostgreSQL")
con <- dbConnect(drv, dbname = "Nutrition",
                 host = "localhost", port = 5432,
                 user = "postgres", password = password)
remove(password)
```

# Exploring 

Neither tables nor columns are named in a clear fashion. We need to explore what's there.

Remember to use `LIMIT` so we don't get too many results.

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT * FROM nut_data LIMIT 5;
```

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT * FROM weight LIMIT 10;
```

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT * FROM weight 
WHERE msre_desc = 'oz'
LIMIT 10;
```


```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT * FROM fd_group LIMIT 15;
```


```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT * FROM datsrcln LIMIT 5;
```

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT * FROM deriv_cd LIMIT 5;
```

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT * FROM food_des LIMIT 10;
```

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT * FROM footnote LIMIT 5;
```

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT * FROM nut_data LIMIT 10;
```

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT * FROM nutr_def LIMIT 5;
```


```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT * FROM src_cd LIMIT 5;
```

# Example

Show 10 products with the highest protein content.
Show also their food groups and their protein ranks withing thier group.

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT
  *
FROM food_des
NATURAL INNER JOIN fd_group
ORDER BY long_desc
LIMIT 10;
```

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT
  long_desc,
  nutr_val,
  units,
  nutrdesc,
  fddrp_desc,
  RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY fddrp_desc ORDER BY nutr_val DESC)
FROM food_des
INNER JOIN nut_data ON food_des.ndb_no = nut_data.ndb_no
NATURAL INNER JOIN nutr_def
NATURAL INNER JOIN fd_group
WHERE  nutrdesc LIKE 'Protein%'
ORDER BY nutr_val DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

* show 10 foods with the highest protein content

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT
  long_desc,
  msre_desc
FROM food_des
NATURAL INNER JOIN weight
NATURAL INNER JOIN fd_group
WHERE  long_desc LIKE '%beer%' AND fddrp_desc = 'Beverages';
```

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT
  msre_desc,
  COUNT(*) AS count
FROM food_des
NATURAL INNER JOIN weight
NATURAL INNER JOIN fd_group
WHERE  long_desc LIKE '%beer%' AND fddrp_desc = 'Beverages'
GROUP BY msre_desc
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

* which measure is the most common for beer?
* how to relate various measures to grams?

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT
  msre_desc,
  AVG(gm_wgt / amount) AS g,
  MIN(gm_wgt / amount) AS g_min,
  MAX(gm_wgt / amount) AS g_max,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM weight
GROUP BY msre_desc
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

* show number of products containing alcohol, by food group

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT *
FROM nutr_def
WHERE nutrdesc LIKE '%Alcohol%'
LIMIT 10;
```

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT
  long_desc,
  nutr_val,
  units,
  nutrdesc,
  fddrp_desc
FROM food_des
NATURAL INNER JOIN nut_data 
NATURAL INNER JOIN nutr_def
NATURAL INNER JOIN fd_group
WHERE tagname = 'ALC' AND nutr_val > 0
ORDER BY nutr_val
LIMIT 10;
```

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT
  fddrp_desc,
  COUNT(*)
FROM food_des
NATURAL INNER JOIN nut_data 
NATURAL INNER JOIN nutr_def
NATURAL INNER JOIN fd_group
WHERE tagname = 'ALC' AND nutr_val > 0
GROUP BY fddrp_desc;
```

* show foods with their calcium content and compare it to the average of their food group

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT *
FROM nutr_def
WHERE nutrdesc LIKE '%Calcium%'
LIMIT 10;
```

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT
  long_desc,
  nutr_val as calcium_mg,
  AVG(nutr_val) OVER (PARTITION BY fddrp_desc),
  fddrp_desc
FROM food_des
NATURAL INNER JOIN nut_data 
NATURAL INNER JOIN nutr_def
NATURAL INNER JOIN fd_group
WHERE tagname = 'CA'
ORDER BY calcium_mg DESC;
```

* for each food group show a product with the highest sugar content

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT *
FROM nutr_def
WHERE nutrdesc LIKE '%Sugar%'
LIMIT 10;
```

```{sql, connection=con}
WITH ranked_by_sugar AS (
  SELECT
    long_desc,
    nutr_val as sugar,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY fddrp_desc ORDER BY nutr_val DESC) as rank,
    fddrp_desc
  FROM food_des
  NATURAL INNER JOIN nut_data 
  NATURAL INNER JOIN nutr_def
  NATURAL INNER JOIN fd_group
  WHERE tagname = 'CA')
SELECT
  long_desc,
  sugar,
  fddrp_desc
FROM ranked_by_sugar
WHERE rank = 1
ORDER BY sugar DESC;
```

* for the 5 most common food groups show 3 most common measure names (e.g. cups)

```{sql, connection=con}
WITH common_food_groups AS (
  SELECT
    fddrp_desc,
    COUNT(*) as counts
  FROM food_des
  NATURAL INNER JOIN fd_group
  GROUP BY fddrp_desc
  ORDER BY counts
  LIMIT 5
),
counted_measures AS (
  SELECT
    fddrp_desc,
    msre_desc,
    COUNT(*) AS counts
  FROM food_des
  NATURAL INNER JOIN weight
  NATURAL INNER JOIN fd_group
  WHERE fddrp_desc IN (SELECT fddrp_desc FROM common_food_groups)
  GROUP BY fddrp_desc, msre_desc
),
ranked AS (
  SELECT
    fddrp_desc,
    msre_desc,
    counts,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY fddrp_desc ORDER BY counts DESC) AS rank_by_food_group
  FROM counted_measures)
SELECT *
FROM ranked
WHERE rank_by_food_group <= 3
ORDER BY counts DESC;
```

* create a view with food name (long_desc), its food group and possible servings

```{sql, connection=con}
CREATE VIEW food AS (
  SELECT
    long_desc AS name,
    amount AS serving_amount,
    msre_desc AS serving_unit,
    fddrp_desc AS food_group
  FROM food_des
  NATURAL INNER JOIN weight
  NATURAL INNER JOIN fd_group
  ORDER BY name
);

SELECT * FROM food;
```

# Extra exercises

* create a few views for the end user - covering the most important information, with nicer table and column names
* food contains ash? invesitage!
* what is the strangest food or component you've found? ;)
