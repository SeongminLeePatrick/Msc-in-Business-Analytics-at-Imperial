```{r}
library(RPostgreSQL)
password <- .rs.askForPassword("You database password.")
drv <- dbDriver("PostgreSQL")
con <- dbConnect(drv, dbname = "postgres",
                 host = "localhost", port = 5432,
                 user = "postgres", password = password)
remove(password)
```



```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT * FROM staff;
```


```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT
  *
FROM
  staff;
```

# 1

Show all columns for the employees who started working not earlier than on 1 Jan 2016 and at the same time earn more than 3500. Order entries by surnames, a->z.

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT *
FROM staff 
WHERE start_date >= '2016-01-01' AND salary > 3500
ORDER BY surname;
```

# 2

Show all other employees (vs 1.sql), but don’t use “NOT” in this query.

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT *
FROM staff 
WHERE start_date < '2016-01-01' OR salary <= 3500
ORDER BY surname;
```

# 3

Show the total number of employees and their average salaries (name it: avg_salary), aggregated by department id. List only departments with at least 4 employees.

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT
    dept_id,
    AVG(salary) AS avg_salary,
    COUNT(*) AS count
FROM staff 
GROUP BY dept_id
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 4;
```

# 4

Show average salary by department colour.

Return table with columns: department_colour, avg_salary.

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT
  colour AS department_colour,
  AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM dept
INNER JOIN staff ON dept.id = staff.dept_id
GROUP BY colour;
```

# 5

Show name, surname and boss_id for each employee whose boss is not present in the staff table. (HINT: you can join a table with itself; in JOIN you can use aliases, e.g. “staff AS bosses”.

```{sql, connection=con}
SELECT
  staff.name,
  staff.surname,
  staff.boss_id
FROM
  staff
LEFT JOIN
  staff AS bosses ON staff.boss_id = bosses.id
WHERE bosses.boss_id is NULL;
```
